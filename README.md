### Our favorite piece of code that we wrote:
#### Joshua:
![img](https://github.com/Joshua722/Dungeons-n-Delicious-Sandwich-Shop/assets/101982787/487faff8-1cf4-445b-985c-bc171a85a089)

This piece of code creates a string with the variable fileName and I included the file path where its going to be at.
Then I concatenate the local date and time while inserting into the time formatter that was created earlier on in
the class. In the next line we will be creating that file with a bufferedWriter, using a BufferedWriter allows to it
be more precise.

Input validation is a very important practice in creating robust and user-friendly programs. In the above code segment, we use a switch statement to handle user input for selecting the size of a sandwich. The while loop that we implemted prompts the user until a valid size (1, 2, or 3) is entered. We believe that this validation is crucial for preventing errors, enhancing the user experience by guiding them to correct inputs, so that the code that is likely dependent on the validated input, executes accurately.


#### Angel:

This connects the order screen which holds the main classes needed to hold inputs from others and information the user adds. 
Also gives the option to exit out the entire program which I always find pretty neat and if the user were to try to input
the wrong number asked for then it would display for them to try again. It was put in a while loop in the event someone 
wants to add a new order.

This luxurious piece of code allows for objects to have String implementations. I like to follow a simple path: K.I.S.S.
It means "Keep It Simple, Stupid" and the toString() override makes output statements as simple as calling the object and
the toString() method applied to the object.
## Conclusion:
DND Sandwich Shop POS is not just a Java CLI application; it represents a thoughtfully designed solution that enhances the customer experience at a sandwich shop. Its user-friendly interface, and collaborative development approach make it a valuable asset for DND as it continues to grow and innovate in the food industry.
