### Our favorite piece of code that we wrote:
#### Joshua:
![img.png](img.png)

This piece of code creates a string with the variable fileName and I included the file path where its going to be at.
Then I concatenate the local date and time while inserting into the time formatter that was created earlier on in
the class. In the next line we will be creating that file with a bufferedWriter, using a BufferedWriter allows to it
be more precise.

This luxurious piece of code allows for objects to have String implementations. I like to follow a simple path: K.I.S.S.
It means "Keep It Simple, Stupid" and the toString() override makes output statements as simple as calling the object and
the toString() method applied to the object.
## Conclusion:
DND Sandwich Shop POS is not just a Java CLI application; it represents a thoughtfully designed solution that enhances the customer experience at a sandwich shop. Its user-friendly interface, and collaborative development approach make it a valuable asset for DND as it continues to grow and innovate in the food industry.
